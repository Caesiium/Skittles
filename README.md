Software engineering prototype project

A prototype of a new proposed project for the Student Smart Homes (SSH) company, to implement a shared groceries ordering page to the existing app. This will allow students to select a supermarket and add items to a shared shopping list. Students will be able to view their own subtotal of their items, along with the total cost. Students will be able to create new orders, join existing orders, check out an order or delete an existing order. The app will also apply any discounts or promotions to all students items equally. Each item added will be labeled with which student added the item. 

All of the edits made to orders will be made through the SSH App, and the final payment will be made through the SSH Console table.
